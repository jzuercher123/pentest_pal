## Features

- **Static Code Analysis**: Automatically analyze source code for potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Dynamic Input Generation**: Generate test inputs to probe web applications for common weaknesses like SQL injection and XSS.
- **Professional Report Generation**: Summarize findings into well-structured, professional reports suitable for stakeholders.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **OpenAI API Key**

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/openai-pentesting-toolkit.git
   cd openai-pentesting-toolkit
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up OpenAI API Key**

   Obtain your API key from the [OpenAI Developer Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

---

## Usage

### Static Code Analysis

Analyze source code for security vulnerabilities.

```python
from analyzer import analyze_code

code_snippet = """
def authenticate(user_input):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + user_input + "';"
    execute(query)
"""

report = analyze_code(code_snippet)
print(report)
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Potential SQL Injection vulnerability detected in the `authenticate` function. User input is concatenated directly into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
```

### Dynamic Input Generation

Generate test inputs to check for specific vulnerabilities.

```python
from input_generator import generate_test_inputs

vulnerability = "SQL injection"
test_inputs = generate_test_inputs(vulnerability)
print(test_inputs)
```

**Sample Output:**

```
- "' OR '1'='1"
- "'; DROP TABLE users; --"
- "' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL --"
```

### Report Generation

Create a professional report summarizing your findings.

```python
from reporter import generate_report

findings = """
1. SQL Injection vulnerability found in login form.
2. Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in search functionality.
"""

report = generate_report(findings)
print(report)
```

**Sample Output:**

```
# Security Assessment Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the security vulnerabilities identified during the assessment.

## Findings

### 1. SQL Injection in Login Form

- **Description**: The login form is susceptible to SQL Injection attacks.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to user data and database manipulation.
- **Recommendation**: Implement prepared statements with parameterized queries.

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting in Search Functionality

- **Description**: User input is not properly sanitized in the search feature.
- **Impact**: Execution of malicious scripts in the user's browser.
- **Recommendation**: Implement input validation and output encoding.
```

## Ethical Considerations

- **Authorization**: Ensure you have explicit permission before testing any systems.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to all relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards.
- **Data Privacy**: Handle all sensitive data responsibly and securely.
- **Disclosure**: Follow responsible disclosure policies when reporting vulnerabilities.
